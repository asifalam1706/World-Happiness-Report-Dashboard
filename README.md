# World-Happiness-Report-Dashboard
## Project Overview:
This project focuses on visualizing data from the World Happiness Report to provide insights into various factors contributing to the happiness of different countries. The dashboard includes multiple visualizations that present key metrics such as happiness scores, GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and more.
## Data Source:
The data used in this project was collected from the official World Happiness Report website: <a href='https://worldhappiness.report/'> World Happiness Report.</a> The dataset includes information about happiness scores and the factors that explain these scores for various countries.
## Objective:
The goal of this dashboard is to present an interactive, easy-to-understand overview of global happiness metrics. Users can explore the data by country and gain insights into the factors influencing happiness, such as GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy.
## Visualizations Used:
__1. Maximum Happiness Score (Card View):__ Displays the country with the highest happiness score.

**2. Highest GDP per Capita (Card View):** Shows the country with the highest GDP per capita.

**3. Social Support (Card View):** Highlights the country with the strongest social support.

**4. Log GDP per Capita by Country (Clustered Column Chart):** A comparison of GDP per capita across various countries.

**5. Overall Report by Country (Line Chart):** Shows the trend of happiness scores for each country.

**6. Sum of Happiness Score by Country (Map Visualization):** A world map that displays the total happiness score by country, providing a geographical perspective.

**7. Social Support by Country (Line Chart):** Shows social support levels across different countries.

**8. Pie Chart (Happiness Score vs. Healthy Life Expectancy):** Compares the sum of happiness scores with the sum of the healthy life expectancy factor.

## Interactivity:
- The dashboard allows users to click on a country in any visualization (such as the map) and see the related happiness score and ranking in the card view.
- The rankings for happiness and related factors dynamically update based on the selected country.
## Insights:
- Countries like Finland, Denmark, and Iceland consistently rank high in happiness scores, largely due to strong social support, healthy life expectancy, and GDP per capita.
- Visualizing factors such as social support and GDP per capita helps to understand the key contributors to happiness for different nations.
